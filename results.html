          <b><p>Dear Divine Enyi,  <br>
          Thank you for all that you have done this 2021 year. This year I was fortunate enough to call you <br>
          a classmate and friend. I am very thankful for the memories we have made and everything you have done <br> 
          for me this year! However, after careful consideration, I regret to inform you that you have <br>
          not made the cut into my 2022 new year. Though we are unable to move into this new year together please <br>
          do not be sadden with the decison that you have been given. This has absolutly nothing to do with your <br>
          character and the type of person you are. If it were up to me you would have made the cut because you are <br>
          a have a great personality and good character. Unfortunately, this year, with a pool of other caring and loving <br>
          people you are not going to be continuing this 2022 journey with me as a friend. <br> 
          Again please take no offense to this news and enjoy your new year :) </p>

          <p>“If ever there is tomorrow when we're not together... <br> 
           there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, <br>
         stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, <br>
          even if we're apart... I'll always be with you.” <br> - Christopher Robin </p>
